 Hey,
 As you may have noticed I haven't done anything with Rails/Ruby or anything on this blog in months,I've been working with python to build some projects I've been working on.  I'm a bit sick of python after all this time, after all variety is the spice of life so I'm going to start a new project in Rails, involving python.  I'm going to convert a flashcard program called mnemosyne[http://mnemosyne-proj.org/] into a beautiful rails based web interface.  To do this I will take 3 steps:
 1.Learn Ruby
 2. Restart/Finish one month Rails tutorial
 3. Study the python backend of the flashcard program
 4. Write the sudocode for the system and then implement it
 5. Design the U.I.
